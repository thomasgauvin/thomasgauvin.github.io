##### *Don't be afraid of negative feedback. True failure is not getting the feedback, which is necessary to learn.*

I'm entering my fourth year of university. Over the past 3 years, I learned many skills to build my dream apps. I also built many cool projects.

However, once I had built these projects, I would display them on my shelf (my Github). This was a mistake.

I'm realizing that I should have been deploying my projects as early as possible so that I can get feedback from my friends and improve my project. While this is may be a scary thing to do, it is also how you learn.

Tomorrow, I'll be deploying my first project.
