Podcast listenership was growing 50% YoY during the past few years.

Now, it's actually experiencing a decrease. Per [podnews](https://podnews.net/article/coronavirus-covid19-affecting-podcasting), podcast listenership is down about 20% since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Why is that the case?

While people are stuck at home, they no longer have to commute, [which is a main activity during which people listen to podcasts.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/discoverpods.com/podcast-statistics/amp/)

Moreover, people are able to give their undivided attention to a single source of entertainment: video. [Netflix](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/netflix-posts-explosive-growth-boom-long-200421232346508.html) and [TikTok](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/26/how-coronavirus-helped-tiktok-find-its-voice) are seeing and incredible boom during this stay-at-home experiment.

# The key takeaway?

In the world of entertainment, audio is a second class citizen to video. Video is more captivating and keeps our attention longer. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that, if it were an option, people would watch videos during their commute instead of listening to podcasts. And that may become a reality in the future; the cost of mobile data will decrease, and self-driving cars will allow us to dedicate our full attention. 

# What's podcasting's edge?

Podcasting and audio in general need to take advantage of their strength: you can listen in the background.

You can't constantly listen to TikTok's and YouTube videos. You need to put the phone down at some point. However, with audio, you could easily go on with your day, while keeping the entertainment and education stream flowing.
