This past week, I tried to deploy a side project (SharedMic). I posted it on Product Hunt, Reddit, sent it to Facebook groups.

We had some success getting a few dozen users onboard. However, after the initial launch, few users stayed on the platform and returned the next day (there's a term for that: churn).

# How do you make sure that your product keeps growing?

So of course, we had to continue to try to get more users and keep growing; after all, that's the mission of every new product. But now, we had nowhere left to post, and we didn't want to be spammy. What's more, we still wanted to make sure that we get quality users that are interested in our product.

# So what's the solution?

The solution is quite simple (even though we didn't like it). Before even starting to build your product, you have to start building an audience.

That can be in the form of a newsletter, a blog, a twitter account, anything that let's you build a following related to your idea.

# An example

In the case of SharedMic (a social platform for podcast listeners and creators), I think one solution could have been to have a daily newsletter of our favorite podcast for that day and see if we're able to have a following around that.

By first building that audience, we would not only have gained the first users of our platform, but we would also have validated our idea with the simplest minimum viable product possible.

We're planning on taking those steps now, but we should have started with this.

# But why should YOU have an audience?

I used to think that I didn't really need a personal brand. I could just work in the background while others would take care of the marketing.

But what I'm realizing is that that audience is very important to launching your projects and getting support behind them. With an audience, you can easily release a product and get initial users who are (likely) interested in what you're building and are willing to give it a try (after all, they value what you say, so why wouldn't they value what you build).

Moreover, if you are remotely interested in the product side, you should want to have an audience as that puts you in direct contact with potential users. That way, you can learn from their experience and get direct feedback.

I'm looking forward to providing value through any means possible.
