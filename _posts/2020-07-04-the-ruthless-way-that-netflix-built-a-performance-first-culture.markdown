The other day, I was listening to [a podcast on the beginnings of Netflix](https://mastersofscale.com/reed-hastings-culture-shock/) and how it became such a great company.

One of the main topics that was covered was that of the 'keeper test'. 

Essentially, the keeper test states that as a manager, you should ask yourself the following: 

> “Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job at a competitor or peer company would I fight hard to keep?”

# Why is the keeper test important?

As a manager, you have a duty to make sure that your team is performing well, and you need to make sure that everybody is giving their A-effort. 

More importantly, you have to **make sure that none of your employees are dragging others down**, because this discourages the rest of the team. It will only be a matter of time before the performance of the team spirals down.

In the podcast, Patty McCord, the chief talent officer of Netflix at the time, explains that she had to cut staff during the fight against Blockbuster. What ended up happening is that they got twice the amount of stuff done in half the time.

Therefore, the keeper test ensures that the team is at the top of its game. After all, that's why Netflix refers to themselves as a team, not a family.

PS: if you're interested in learning more about the Netflix culture, here's a slide deck from Reed Hastings, CEO of the company: [https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/reed2001/culture-1798664](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/reed2001/culture-1798664)
