                <p class="main-text">Hi! I am a Software Engineering student at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. 
                    I have experience in leading student groups and teams, building projects and taking on responsibilities, all of which have kept me productive and happy over the years.
                    Throughout the years, I've gained immense experience in many different areas, whether it be working in small local businesses, in physics and biology research labs, in student 
                    associations or in companies through my internships and look forward to applying that experience in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am an active member of the student community at Concordia, where I represent the undergrads of my department
                    at faculty and department meetings, host coding nights in collaboration with the Software and Computer Science Society (SCS) of Concordia, 
                    organize engineering events such as Freshman Orientation and Department Meet and Greets, and represent Concordia University at the Quebec Engineering Games
                    as part of the Concordia delegation. I am very passionate about making the experience of my fellow classmates the best it can be, and have always been.

                <p>
                    The field of Software really interests me for its ability to scale and become an important tool in the life of millions. I am excited about the possibilities
                    that are arising in the different sectors of the field and actively seek to learn more about them everyday. I regularly participate in Hackathons where I learn about bleeding-edge
                    technologies that enable developers to create new and engaging experiences for the user. In 2018, I've attended ConUHacks, McHacks, BostonHacks, BlocHacks and YHacks where I developed
                    various different proof of concept applications touching many areas such as the smart home, refugees in Montreal, Natural Language chatbots and more. To see more on these projects,
                    visit <a href="https://github.com/thomasgauvin">my github!</a> I am often referred to as a workaholic, as when I find a project that I am passionate about, it becomes 
                    the only thing on which I spend my time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I am not in school or coding, I am usually enjoying the fresh air camping in the beautiful Adirondacks or the Canadian outdoors. I also enjoy travel,
                    having been on cultural trips in India, Vietnam and China in the past few years. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am looking forward to building the next big thing. Feel free to reach out at thomasgauvin.cu@gmail.com or send me a message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-gauvin/">LinkedIn</a>.
